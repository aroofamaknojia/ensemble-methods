Implementing ensemble methods and comparing their accuracies
Using a Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, I preprocessed the data and normalized it before I split it up into a training and testing data set. 
The ensemble methods I explored are:
1. Generic Bagging Ensemble
2. Random Forest
3. ADA Boosting Model
4. Voting Classifier with an ensemble of a Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression
The Best model among them was the ADA Boost Model.
